thongs
======

Thongs captures ethernet packets from specified (or all) interfaces. Captured packets are written in pcapNG formatted file which can be later opened by bunch of applications including wireshark. Thongs supports &lt;93>raw&lt;94> include/exclude/highlight filters in same fashion as nibbles. These filters evaluate the packet data exactly as it is displayed on screen. Current version also includes protocol specific filters for certain protocols.  Thongs can now also send ethernet frames. Press F3 at runtime to enable sending view.  Added protocol specific (highlight) filters + human readable output for: Ethernet IPv4 ARP UDP  Current protocol based highlight filters:  ETHERNET:     dst                    destination mac format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff              src                    source mac format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff vlan                  VLAN ID  IPv4:         dip                    destination IP in dotted decimal format sip                    source IP in dotted decimal format ttl                     TTL value len                    Total Len  ARP:         dip                     destination IP in dotted decimal format sip                     source IP in dotted decimal format dmac                    destination mac in format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff smac                    source mac in format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff req                     ARP packet with response mode (No value needed) resp                    ARP packet with response mode (No value needed)  UDP:         dport                   destination port sport                  source port len                     UDP data length
