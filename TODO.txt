TODO - list.

1. add "always matching when correct protocol" - filters which can be used to match protocol. Eg commands like:
    > eth all 
    > ip4 all

2. Create own set of filters for -E switch (prefiltering) to be passed down to bs_read(). This will allow setting highlight filter independently from this "what to write in file" - filter.

3. protocol level filtering for display - at least UDP+UDPCP+SYSCOM

4. Remove unused portions and create selecting menu window for filters

5. rewrite man pages

6. possibly integrate epb to this tool.
