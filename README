T.H.O.N.G.S   -  
Textmode Helper On Network Getting Sniffed version 0.5 is out.

This project's roots are in nibbles, and lots of nibbles related things are still floating around.
However I am slowly getting rid of those.

At runtime you can toggle different windows by pressing F2, F3, F4, F5 and F6.


Thongs captures ethernet packets from specified (or all) interfaces. Captured packets are written in pcapNG formatted file which can be later opened by bunch of applications including wireshark.
Thongs supports “raw” include/exclude/highlight filters in same fashion as nibbles. These filters evaluate the packet data exactly as it is displayed on screen.
Current version also includes protocol specific filters for certain protocols.

Thongs can now also send ethernet frames. Press F3 at runtime to enable sending view.

Added protocol specific (highlight) filters + human readable output for:
Ethernet
IPv4
ARP
UDP

Current protocol based highlight filters:

ETHERNET:
	dst                    destination mac format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 
             src                    source mac format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 
vlan                  VLAN ID

IPv4:
       	dip                    destination IP in dotted decimal format 
sip                    source IP in dotted decimal format 
ttl                     TTL value
len                    Total Len

ARP:
    	dip                   	destination IP in dotted decimal format
sip                   	source IP in dotted decimal format
dmac                	destination mac in format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
smac                 	source mac in format aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
req                    	ARP packet with response mode (No value needed)
resp                  	ARP packet with response mode (No value needed)

UDP:
       	dport                 	destination port
sport                  source port
len                    	UDP data length


NOTE: All filters apply only displayed data, not data stored in file.


BUGS:
Scrolling does not work correctly.
Most of the protocol filters are quite untested. Also there may be some endianess issues left in header printings.


TODO:
-	UDPCP protocol.
-	Fix scrolling for this version.
-	Create version with fixed size ram buffer capture – perhaps no scrolling.
-	Allow filtering packets which are shown/written to file.



--Enjoy.
